Notes: The center point is at offset (128,224) by default. Raise the sprites by 96 pixels
       to put them at their absolute center instead of the lower-biased offset (characters
       rarely extend lower than 32 pixels past their center point). Sprites that extend past
       the 256x256 boundary are still centered accordingly (for example, a 512-pixel height
       means there's an extra 128 extra pixels on the top and bottom, making (128,352) the
       absolute center for those). Animations with repeated frames are mentioned as such in
       their filenames. Underscores imply separate frame numbers (e.g. "03_11_19_27" = frames
       4, 12, 20, and 28), whereas dashes signify frame ranges (e.g. "03-06" = frames 4 to 7).
